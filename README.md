# Docker status
Currently the docker container builds and runs but must specify environment vari
ables that is:

* PORT - listening port
* DB_USER - database username
* DB_PWD - database password
* DB_NAME - database name
* TOKEN_PWD - token password

# TODO
- [ ] Rename environment variables to be more clear and readable
- [ ] Setup `docker-compose` to work with both the app and `PostgreSQL`
